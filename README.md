# CP Library

## Stress Testing
The Stress Test folder in this repository contains code and bash scripts designed for stress testing competitive programming problems that yield a singular comparable output.

## Templates
This folder contains some of my templates for cp:

##### Debugging Template
This template can debug most of the data structures in C++ STL. But, it can't debug arrays.

##### Algo-Plate
It includes a collection of basic algorithms and handy tricks.

##### VS Code Snippets
It's a .json file that contains few algo and shortcuts that pops up while writing code in Vs Code.
