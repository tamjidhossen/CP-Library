<span style="font-size:5em;">**Stress Testing**</span>  
The Stress Test folder in this repository contains code and bash scripts designed for stress testing competitive programming problems that yield a singular comparable output.

<span style="font-size:5em;">**Templates**</span>  
This folder contains some of my templates for cp:

***Debugging Template*** 
This template can debug most of the data structures in C++ STL. But, it can't debug arrays.

***Algo Plate***  
It includes a collection of basic algorithms and handy tricks.

***VS Code Snippets***  
It's a .json file that contains a few algo and shortcuts that pop up while writing code in Vs Code.
